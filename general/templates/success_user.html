      Please check out the links below if you'd like to know more about any of
      the security topics covered in the survey.

    <h3 class='f3-l f4 b ph4-l ph2 green'>Achievable security toolkit!</h3>
    <p class='f4 ph4-l ph2'>
      The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a program called
      <a href='https://ssd.eff.org/' class='link dim green' target='blank'>Surveillance
        Self-Defence</a>, which helps you understand and avoid surveillance online.
      </p>
    <h3 class='f3-l f4 b ph4-l ph2 green'>If you only do one thing, use 2FA</h3>
    <p class='f4 ph4-l ph2'>
      Use two factor authentication (also called multi-factor authentication,
      or 2FA) where you can, but especially on important
      services like your email account, your bank, and places where you store
      the things you care most about (your home address, your photos, etc).
    </p>
    <p class='f4 ph4-l ph2'>
      There's a great run-down on multi-factor authentication
      <a href='https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-enable-two-factor-authentication' class='link dim green' target='blank'>
      here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 class='f3-l f4 b ph4-l ph2 green'>Passwords and password managers</h3>
    <p class='f4 ph4-l ph2'>
      Getting a password manager will help you set more secure passwords
      (long ones!), and means you don't have to remember them all.
      It's explained well
      <a href='https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords' class='link dim green' target='blank'>
      here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 class='f3-l f4 b ph4-l ph2 green'>Have you been hacked?</h3>
    <p class='f4 ph4-l ph2'>
      You can check your email to see if any of your logins have been stolen or
      compromised, by going to
      <a href='https://haveibeenpwned.com' class='link green dim' target='blank'>
      haveibeenpwned.com</a>. There are instructions on what to do if you're
      email comes up on a hacked list.
    </p>
    <p class='f4 ph4-l ph2'>
      If you know you have had photos stolen, you should check out
      <a href='https://badassarmy.org' class='link green dim' target='blank'>
